/**
  * Encrypted and/or hashed data fields which need to be sent to Nuance to support Virtual Assistant
  * userid-recovery-api microservice will pick up these encrypted values, decrypt and pass
  * on to Nuance.  Encryption is necessary to avoid plaintext JSON data in the HTML.
  *
  * This class implements the encryption algorithm as agreed in AIV-1751
  *
  * Each plaintext value is prefixed by a Sha512 hash for receiver verification purposes
  * Then, the combined result is encrypted with AES256CGM using a shared secret
  * Finally, the Ciphertext is preprended with "ENCRYPTED-"
  *
  * nuanceSessionId: hashed SessionId value  (for gov.uk chat client session tracking)
  * mdtpSessionId: encrypted SessionId value (for TXM auditing)
  * deviceId: encrypted DeviceId value (for TXM auditing)
